This code is licensed under BSD 3-Clause License so it is free for anyone to modify, redistribute or use in anyway they want.
Please don't flame my coding, I've learned a lot while working on this and there is a lot that can and should be done differently. Pointers are appreciated.


**Requirements**

- Nginx, Apache, Cherokee..
- PHP 5.5 or later
- MySQL server


**Admin User**

The password for the admin page is hashed using bcrypt.
To generate your own you can use the feature on the admin/login.php page

- admin/login.php?hash=

Then insert a new row in the database under the table "users".
